**CoSpar** is a toolkit for dynamic inference from lineage-traced single cells. |br|
The methods are based on
`Wang et al. Nat. Biotech. (2022) <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-022-01209-1>`_.

Dynamic inference based on single-cell state measurement alone requires serious simplifications. On the other hand, direct dynamic measurement via lineage tracing only captures partial information and its interpretation is challenging. CoSpar integrates both state and lineage information to infer a finite-time transition map of a development/differentiation system. It gains superior robustness and accuracy by exploiting both the local coherence and sparsity of differentiation transitions, i.e., neighboring initial states share similar yet sparse fate outcomes.  Building around the :class:`~anndata.AnnData` object, CoSpar provides an integrated analysis framework for datasets with both state and lineage information. When only state information is available, CoSpar also improves upon existing dynamic inference methods by imposing sparsity and coherence. It offers essential toolkits for analyzing lineage data, state information, or their integration.

CoSpar's key applications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- infer transition maps from lineage data, state measurements, or their integration.
- predict the fate bias of progenitor cells.
- order cells along a differentiation trajectory leading to a given cell fate.
- predict gene expression dynamics along a trajectory.
- predict genes whose expression correlates with future fate outcome.
- generate a putative fate hierarchy, ordering fates by their lineage distances.
